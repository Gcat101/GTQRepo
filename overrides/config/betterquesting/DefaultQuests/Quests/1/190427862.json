To get iron, you will be needing to process ores in the Bloomery.\nTo do this, you will have to;\n\n§6Get Ore: §fGT Oreveins are commonly found.\n\n§6Smelt ore in the Bloomery§f, and... wait.. (this can be sped up using Bellows or Mechanical Bellows)\n\n§bTake out the Bloom§f and strike it with a hammer, either on your anvil or on the ground. this yields slag,\nand most importantly Nuggets of whatever metal you\u0027re processing.\n\nThis is a major step towards the Steam Age, and unlocks GT Tools and most of TCon.\n\nThe smeltery, however, requires Obsidian gears. So you will still need to smash down some obsidian and diamonds to get to the Smeltery and finish the Stone Age.",
